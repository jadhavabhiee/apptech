      <h1>About SANIR ARUN KITTUR</h1>
      <p>
        APTECH was established in 2011 with the intention to provide the right
        path and guidance to students who are ambitious and think high into
        their careers. Sanir Kittur, founder and Chairperson of APTECH is
        himself a master of aptitude. He is known for his lightening fast
        calculations, calender method and various "easy to solve" formulas, all
        invented and derived by him. He is very rightly known as Apti-King by
        his student and follows a friendly nature with the students. Over the
        years he has been a teacher, a guru, an advisor, a friend in agony and
        most importantly a motivator to all his students. Right from its
        inception, APTECH has had an obsession with consistent quality which
        till today is the hallmark of the institution. APTECH and Sanir Kittur
        has always gone that extra mile to ensure that students have the best
        faculty to teach them along with right ambiance to set the backdrop for
        the best learning experience. We make sure that our lectures set a bench
        mark in quality and standard
